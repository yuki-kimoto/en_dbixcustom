<h2> Delete row with delete method </ h2>

Use the <strong> delete </ strong> method to delete a table row.

<pre>
$ dbi-> delete (
  table =>'book',
  where => {id => 1},
);
</ pre>

Specify the target table with <strong> table </ strong>. Specify the condition of the row to be deleted with <strong> where </ strong>. Where can be a hash reference or a DBIx :: Custom :: Where object.

The following SQL is issued:

<pre>
delete from book where id =?;
</ pre>

The corresponding value is embedded in the placeholder.

<h3> Delete method options </ h3>

The delete method can use all the options of "<a href="/blog/20110708131364.html"> execute method </a>". It also implements the following options.

<h4> Specifying conditions by ID id </ h4>

You can specify the condition by ID by using the id option. The primary_key must be set.

<pre>
id => 4
id => [4, 5]
</ pre>

Suppose you want to execute a delete like the one below.
<pre>

$ dbi-> delete (
  primary_key => ['id1','id2'],
  id => [4, 5],
  table =>'book',
);
</ pre>

This is the same as delete below.

<pre>
$ dbi-> delete (where => {id1 => 4, id2 => 5}, table =>'book');
</ pre>

<h4> prefix prefix </ h4>

Use the prefix option to set a string between delete and from table.

<pre>
prefix =>'some'
</ pre>

For example, the following SQL is executed.

<pre>
delete some from book
</ pre>

<h4> table name table </ h4>

Specify the table name with the table option.

<pre>
table =>'book'
</ pre>

<h4> Where clause where </ h4>

Use the where option to write a Where clause.

<pre>
where => {author =>'Ken','title' =>'Perl'}
where => [
  ['and',': author {=}',': title {like}'],
  {author =>'Ken', title =>'% Perl%'}
]
</ pre>

See "where option" in "<a href="/blog/20110210130016.html"> select method </a>" for how to specify the where option. See <a href="/blog/20110924132031.html"> Dynamic Where Clause Generation </a> for more information on Where clause generation.

<h3> Delete all lines delete_all </ h3>

Use the <strong> delete_all </ strong> method to delete all the rows in the table. The delete method cannot delete all rows for safety reasons, so use the delete_all method.

<pre>
$ dbi-> delete_all (table =>'book');
</ pre>

Specify the target table with <strong> table </ strong>.

The following SQL is issued:

<pre>
delete from book;
</ pre>
